1.
Step 1: save the content to a file locally
Step 2: load the local file using
  psql -d test < films1.sql
- the file creates a table called 'films' and populates it w/ data
- output of the cmds is
  NOTICE:  table "films" does not exist, skipping
  DROP TABLE
  CREATE TABLE
  INSERT 0 1
  INSERT 0 1
  INSERT 0 1
- the first cmd drops the (public ?) table if it exists

2.
SELECT * FROM films;

3.
SELECT * FROM films WHERE length(title) < 12;

4.
ALTER TABLE films
  ADD COLUMN director varchar(50),
  ADD COLUMN duration int DEFAULT 0;

5.
UPDATE films SET director = 'John McTiernan', duration = 132 WHERE title = 'Die Hard';
UPDATE films SET director = 'Michael Curtiz', duration = 102 WHERE title = 'Casablanca';
UPDATE films SET director = 'Francis Ford Coppola', duration = 113 WHERE title = 'The Conversation';

6.
INSERT INTO films (title, "year", genre, director, duration) VALUES
('1984',  1956,  'scifi',   'Michael Anderson',  90),
('Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy',   2011,  'espionage',   'Tomas Alfredson',   127),
('The Birdcage',  1996,  'comedy',  'Mike Nichols',  118);

7.
SELECT title, date_part('year', now()) - "year" AS age FROM films ORDER BY age;

from the solution, the following also works:
SELECT title, extract("year" from current_date) - "year" AS age FROM films ORDER BY age;

8.
SELECT title, duration FROM films WHERE duration > 2 * 60 ORDER BY duration DESC;

9.
SELECT title FROM films ORDER BY duration DESC LIMIT 1;
